        <h1>What is the Church of the flying Spaghetti Monster?</h1>
        <p>
            The church is what seems to be a satrical take on religion, though most of it's followers will say otherwise. It's a church about worshiping a flying spaghetti monster. That's it. Theres not much more to dig up on this topic and there might be some stuff I can't say in this prject due to the guidelines. I encrouage you to do your own research if you're interested.
